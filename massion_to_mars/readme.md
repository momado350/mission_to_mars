In this Project, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. First thing first I Completed my initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Splinter. Then I Scraped the NASA Mars News Site and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Then Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called featured_image_url. I also Visited the Mars Weather twitter account and scraped the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Saved the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called mars_weather. And Visited the Mars Facts webpage and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass,etc. finally Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
